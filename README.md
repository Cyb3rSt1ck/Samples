This project was designed to assist chemists with sorting new chemical compounds and structures they create within a virtual storage vault.

The intigration is designed around Signals Notebook and CDD Vault, it allows any chemical structure or compound created within the notebook to be transferred with a click of a button. Tracking the chemist who created the compound,
the IUPAC ID, Salt Content, and other values using a series of push, pull and get commands.

Including the data that is transferred, it would also create and upload chemical structure, allowing for visualization of what was created.

After the data was transferred a Hyperlink is created on the signals notebook page allowing anyone to click and navigate to the storage location with ease. Any changes made to the original signals notebook can also be pushed to update the existing items within the vault.
